Agenda: - Agenda of this video is that to create a mysql database container for practice purpose for those student/learners who wants to practice database concepts locally.

Pre-requisite: - You should have docker installed on your system.

Steps:-

Step 1> Open docker desktop application check docker is running or not and then create a volume using volumes option in docker desktop application.

Step 2> Pull latest mysql image from docker hub. Here in this example, I will use latest image.

Step 3> Run below docker command for creating mysql database container.
command: - docker run --detach --name=mysql-server --env="MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=loki" --publish 6603:3306 --volume=mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql

ref:- Here we are using "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" as environment variable for set your database password.

Step 4> Download MYSQL workbench tool for accessing your container base mysql database.
ref:- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Step 5> Open MYSQL workbench tool clicks on database then click on connect to database then enter hostname as "127.0.0.1", port number as "6603" and username as "root".

Step 6> After stablishing connection create database in mysql database using below command.
show databases;
CREATE DATABASE sample;
use sample;
show tables;
CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
show tables;
describe pet;

Note:- Purpose of step 1 was to create permanent storage point for our database. For example if I will create an any database object in my present container and my current container get 
destroy and then you will create other container with same volume so in that condition you can access your old object as well.
